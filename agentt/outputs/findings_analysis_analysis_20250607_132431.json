Predicting crop yield accurately is\nimportant to help farmers optimize their practices and secure food supplies, yet\ntraditional crop yield predictions often rely on historical data or farmers’ in-\nstincts, which don’t fully account for the complex interactions between crops\nand changing environmental conditions [6] [4].\nRecent advancements in machine learning have greatly enhanced the accu-\nracy of predictions, particularly with models such as random forests and support\n\nvector machines [4]. Unlike traditional models, these approaches can effectively\ncapture the intricate relationships between crop yield and various environmental\nfactors, making them robust in the face of changing climate conditions. By inte-\ngrating machine learning with cloud-based systems, farmers can access real-time\npredictions, allowing them to adjust their strategies based on timely insights [5].\nThispaperintroducesacomprehensiveplatformthatleveragesmachinelearn-\ning models to improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, ultimately support-\ning farmers.

Furthermore, the\nplatform features a multilingual AI chatbot, designed to assist farmers and other\nusers with their inquiries, enabling them to make well-informed decisions in their\nwork [14][6].\nThrough this platform, we aim to bolster resilience in agriculture, assisting\nfarmers in managing risks, optimizing resource allocation, and boosting produc-\ntivity. Our objective is to establish a sustainable agricultural framework that\nbenefits both farmers and their communities.\n2 Related Work\nRecent advancements in machine learning have greatly enhanced the accuracy of\npredictions, particularly with models such as random forests and support vector\nmachines [3][6][7].

Additionally, meteorological data from NASA, including tem-\nperature, precipitation, and humidity, was integrated. This combined dataset\nspans 26 years, forming a robust longitudinal foundation for crop yield predic-\ntion. It comprises 103 initial features representing crop characteristics, weather\n3\n\nconditions, soil properties, temporal factors, and spatial locations, covering all\nsouthern states and select regions in northern India.\n3.2 Data Cleaning\nTo enhance data quality, missing values were addressed by interpolation for me-\nteorological variables and mean imputation for agronomic data. Certain records\nwith incomplete data were removed, and relevant transformations were applied\nto standardize entries based on year, location, and crop type. Outliers were de-\ntected and treated accordingly to ensure data consistency. The final cleaned\ndataset comprises 25 selected features and 53,651 observations, ensuring an op-\ntimal balance between data richness and reliability.\n3.3 Data Preprocessing\nData visualization techniques, including heatmaps and correlation matrices with\na threshold of 0.8, were employed to assess feature relationships and select key\nvariables. Categorical features, such as crop type, were label-encoded, while con-\ntinuous variables were standardized to support stable model convergence. Fea-\nture engineering was applied to construct interaction terms, capturing complex\ndependencies among agronomic, climatic, and temporal factors.\n3.4 Model Training and Evaluation\nTo optimize predictive accuracy, several models were tested, including a cus-\ntomized Sequential Neural Network, Random Forest, Linear Regression, and an\nensemble model that combined these approaches. The dataset was split into an\n80% training set and a 20% testing set. Model performance was evaluated using\nmetrics such as R2, adjusted R2, Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute\nError (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To improve generalizabil-\nity and reduce overfitting K-fold cross-validation was applied. Table 1 shows a\ndetailed comparison of each model’s performance.\nTable 1. Performance Metrics of Various Models\nModel R2Adjusted R2MSE MAE RMSE\nRandom Forest 0.906 0.902 0.386 0.339 0.123\nNeural Network 0.83 0.82 0.018 0.14 0.135\nEnsemble 0.869 0.867 0.507 0.569 0.711\n4\n\n3.5 Fine Tuning\nTo enhance model accuracy and robustness, hyperparameter tuning was per-\nformed. Initial parameters were optimized through Grid Search and Random\nSearch, focusing on elements such as the number of trees, model depth, learning\nrates, and activation functions. For additional efficiency, Bayesian Optimization\nwas employed to fine-tune batch size, dropout rate, and network architecture.\nThis tuning process resulted in notable performance improvements, with final\nparameters selected for deployment.\n4 Proposed Solution\nThe proposed solution offers farmers tailored crop recommendations utilizing\nreal-time data, user inputs, and support features enhanced by machine learning\nand GPS integration using APIs. The workflow includes the following steps:\n1.UserInputCollection: Userssupplycriticalinformation,suchassoiltype,\ntotal area, and the crops previously cultivated.\n2.Resource Tracking via GPS: Using integrated GPS, the system automat-\nicallytracksresourcesspecifictotheuser’slocation,suchaswateravailability\nand regional characteristics.\n3.CropYieldPrediction: Leveragingamachinelearningandneuralnetwork\nmodeltrainedonhistoricalandenvironmentaldata,thesystemcombinesthe\nuser’s inputs with GPS-based data to predict and recommend the top three\ncrops expected to yield the highest productivity under given conditions.\n4.Crop Selection and Guidance: Upon selecting a recommended crop, the\nuser is provided with comprehensive information which includes:\n–Estimated cost for cultivation.\n–Average growing period of the selected crop.\n–Recommendations for optimal cropping techniques, organic fertilizers,\nand resource management.\n5.IntegratedChatbotforAssistance: Foradditionalqueriesordetailedin-\nformation on farming practices, users can consult an integrated multilingual\nchatbot, which provides instant support and tailored advice.\nThis comprehensive solution enables farmers to make data-informed deci-\nsions, optimizing crop yields and sustainable farming practices while providing\naccessible, real-time guidance.\n5 Future Scope\nWhile this project provides a robust solution for crop yield prediction, several\nenhancements can further improve its accuracy, accessibility, and scalability:\n5\n\n1.Advanced Algorithms and Real-Time Data Integration: We aim to\nincorporate more sophisticated algorithms, such as deep learning models,\nto capture complex, non-linear interactions within agronomic data, thus en-\nhancing predictive accuracy. Expanding the dataset to integrate real-time\nsatellite data would allow the model to respond dynamically to rapidly\nchanging environmental conditions, improving its adaptability for precision\nfarming.\n2.IndustryPartnershipsforDirectResourceAccess: Tofacilitateseam-\nless access to quality agricultural resources, we plan to establish partnerships\nwith companies specializing in organic fertilizers, high-yield variety (HYV)\nseeds, and other essential inputs. Through this integration, farmers would\nhave the option to purchase these resources directly through our platform at\ncompetitive prices, promoting cost-effective and sustainable farming prac-\ntices.\n3.Labor Force and Workforce Management System: We envision a\nfarmer registration and networking system on our platform, where farm-\ners can create profiles. This feature will enable those seeking additional la-\nbor during peak seasons to connect with seasonal workers, establishing a\ncommunity-driven approach to address workforce needs efficiently and ben-\nefiting both parties.\n4.Enhanced Virtual Assistance for Crop Management and Disas-\nter Mitigation: Our integrated chatbot could evolve into an advanced vir-\ntual assistant, providing farmers with real-time, interactive advice on crop\nmanagement, disaster mitigation, and efficient resource utilization. This de-\nvelopment would support farmers in making data-driven decisions, further\nincreasing the platform’s value in sustainable agricultural management.\nThese proposed developments aim to expand the platform’s functionality\nand resource accessibility, making it an invaluable tool for farmers in precision\nagriculture.\nConclusion\nThis project presents a predictive platform aimed at improving agricultural pro-\nductivity and fostering sustainable soil health.

It was only in the last century that humankind ﬁnally began taking\nsigniﬁcant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and\nbuilding the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous,\nand astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts\nare at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a\nrapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and\ncorrelation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available\nmicroarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identiﬁed 218 differentially expressed genes between In-ﬂight\nand Pre-ﬂight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations\nacross the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically\ndeveloped a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel.\nFurther studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the\nproposed assay.\nKeywords: space biology; diagnostic assay; health; transcriptome; space ﬂight\n1. Introduction\n“Space: the ﬁnal frontier.” [ 1]. Every fan of the American science ﬁction TV series\nStar Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed,\nspace exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind;\nhowever, it was only in the last century that humankind ﬁnally took a solid step forward\nby sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [ 2,3]. In the 21stcentury,\nhumankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) program [ 4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life\non Mars [ 5,6], and starting private space ventures [ 7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National\nAeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in\n2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [ 9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight\nof crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space.\nSpace travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under\nsustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and\ncosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of\nmuscle mass [ 10,11], reduced bone density [ 12,13], compromised immune responses [ 14,15],\nimpaired renal functions [ 16], neurological system irresponsiveness [ 17,18], and develop-\nment of cardiovascular diseases [ 19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation\ncan cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immu-\nnity [ 21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity\naffects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant\nLife2023 ,13, 576. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13020576 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\n\nLife2023 ,13, 576 2 of 15\nphenotypes [22–24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic ra-\ndiation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in\none gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic\nstudies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on\nhuman health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor,\nprevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel.\nApproximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)\nundertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month\nmission at the ISS [ 25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to conﬁrm that space ﬂight changed gene\nexpression in astronauts [ 25]. Several genes, including FGF18 ,ANGPTL7 , and COMP ,\nwere upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles.\nHowever, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes\non the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in\nthe current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that\ncould monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential\nintervention options.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Data Acquisition\nMicroarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene\nexpression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-\ndata.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression\nproﬁles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009\nand February 2013. For each astronaut, 2 proﬁles were collected at each of the three time\npoints, Pre-ﬂight (prior to departing for the ISS), In-ﬂight (while staying at the ISS), and\nPost-ﬂight (after return to the ground).\n2.2. Data Processing\nIndividual gene expression proﬁles were combined into three DataFrames: Pre-ﬂight,\nIn-ﬂight, and Post-ﬂight using the Pandas package (version 1.3.0) in Python [ 26]. These\nDataFrames were analyzed for possible outliers and veriﬁed for accuracy. Gene expression\nreadings with null values were removed. Then, Agilent IDs in the data were mapped to\ngene names using the Ensembl BioMart database (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/\nmartview, accessed on 15 March 2021).\n2.3. DEG Identiﬁcation and Signaling Pathway Analysis\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs: jlog2FCj\u00153.00 and p< 0.05) were identiﬁed\nbetween the In-ﬂight and the Pre-ﬂight DataFrames using the DEGseq package (version\n1.42.0) in R [ 27]. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) function was applied in the calculation.\nNo DEGs were identiﬁed between the Post-ﬂight and the In-ﬂight DataFrames. The DEGs\nbetween In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight were then subjected to signaling pathway analysis using\nthe InnateDB tool [28].\n2.4. Calculation of Gene Pair Correlation Matrices\nPairwise Pearson correlation coefﬁcient matrices for the 3 gene expression DataFrames\nwere calculated using formula r=S(xi\u0000x)(yi\u0000y)q\nS(xi\u0000x)2S(yi\u0000y)2. The correlation matrices were subse-\nquently transferred to be visualized using an R platform. To analyze gene pair correlations\nfor the signaling pathways, the expression proﬁles of the genes for the pathways were\nextracted from the DataFrames to produce the DataFrame subsets. For each signaling\npathway, pairwise Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were calculated and visualized as out-\nlined above between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight subsets and between the Post-ﬂight and\nIn-ﬂight subsets. Positive and negative correlations were represented in blue and red,\nrespectively. Additionally, gene pair correlation coefﬁcient differentials, DCC (In-Pre) =\n\nLife2023 ,13, 576 3 of 15\nCC In-ﬂight – CC Pre-ﬂight andDCC (Post-In) = CC Post-ﬂight – CC In-ﬂight were calculated by\nmatrix subtraction between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight subsets and between the Post-ﬂight\nand In-ﬂight subsets. These were subsequently visualized with correlation difference plots\nwith positive and negative DCCs shown in green and red, respectively.\n2.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Disease Network Constructions\nThe BioGrid database [ 29] and DisGeNET database [ 30] were downloaded in March\n2021 to create a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and extract the disease interaction\ninformation, respectively, for the DEGs. The networks were then constructed using Python\nand visualized using Cytoscape [31].\n2.6. Drug and miRNA Screenings\nThe Drugbank [ 32] and miRTARBase [ 33] databases were also downloaded in March\n2021 to extract the drug and miRNA interaction information for the DEGs. The networks\nwere subsequently constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape. From these\ntwo networks, we identiﬁed potential drugs and miRNAs targeting the 32 genes that were\nidentiﬁed to be used in a rapid RT2-PCR assay for space travel.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)\nNASA and JAXA undertook Study GLDS-174: “Effects of a closed space environment\non gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station” between\n2009 and 2013. Hair follicles were chosen for this study because they are the easiest\nattainable and noninvasive samples that are understood to be representative of most\nlarge-scale changes in the body [ 25]. However, Terada et al. only reported the expression\nof selected genes in this study and did not undertake further analysis [ 25]. To better\nunderstand how space travel affects astronauts’ health, we downloaded the microarray\ndataset (E-GEOD-74708) from the NASA GeneLab open data repository. The microarray\ndataset includes gene expression information for three stages: Pre-ﬂight (6 months to\n2 weeks before launch), In-ﬂight (while staying in the ISS), and Post-ﬂight (2 days to\n3 months after returning from the ISS). We then analyzed the dataset for gene expression\nand gene pair correlation. Using cut-off criteria of jlog2FCj\u00153.00 and p< 0.05, 218 DEGs\nwere identiﬁed between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight (Supplementary File S1: DEG_list.xls).\nThe top 20 up- and downregulated genes are summarized in Table 1. However, no DEGs\nwere detected between Post-ﬂight and In-ﬂight, suggesting that the astronauts may need\na longer time than current guidelines for the body to adjust to the ground environment.\nFurthermore, astronauts have a much higher risk of developing various types of diseases\nthan normal people and precautionary measures are critical to protect their health after\nreturning to ground.\nAs expected, the DEGs between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight regulate a broad spectrum of\nbiological and physiological functions. For example, the most up-regulated gene LIMCH1 ,\nencoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia com-\nplex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [ 34,35]. Thus, the upregulation\nofLIMCH1 may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells\ninto less malignant phenotypes [ 22–24]. The second most up-regulated gene IER3 encodes\nImmediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [ 36], inﬂammation [ 37], and\ntumorigenesis [ 38]. Upregulation of IER3 has been observed in several types of cancer and\nmay regulate cancer progression [ 39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than\nradiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a pro-\nlonged period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene, NFATC1, encodes Nuclear\nFactor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [ 41],\nosteoclastogenesis [ 42], T-cell differentiation [ 43], lymphatic endothelial development [ 44],\ncardiac valve morphogenesis [ 45], and tumorigenesis [ 46]. The downregulation of NFATC1\nmay result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astro-\n\nLife2023 ,13, 576 4 of 15\nnauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene, KIDINS220 ,\nencoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function\nof the nerve and cardiovascular systems [ 47,48]. The downregulation of KIDINS220 may\ncontribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in\nastronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the\nDEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–\n30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space.

Gene Pair Correlations\nAs mentioned above, the effect of space travel on an astronaut’s health is comprehen-\nsive and involves the regulation of many genes. It is also well-known that any biological,\nphysiological, or pathophysiological change requires a delicate coordination of multiple\ngenes. Therefore, we decided to carry out a gene pair correlation analysis for the whole\ngenome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) among the Pre-ﬂight, In-ﬂight, and Post-ﬂight\nexpression proﬁles. As shown in Figure 1A, the genes are highly correlated in the Pre-ﬂight,\nwhich is consistent with previous studies showing that gene expressions are correlated in\nnormal human tissues [ 49]. Upon staying in the ISS for an extended period of 6 months, the\ngenome signiﬁcantly lost its regulation of the gene expression and gene coordination was\nscrambled (Figure 1B). Our previous studies have shown that loss of gene pair correlations\nis a hallmark of carcinogenesis and/or cancer progression [ 50–52]. Therefore, loss of coordi-\nnation of gene expression, other than cosmic radiation and compromised immune system,\nis likely to be another factor that increases the risk of cancer development in astronauts.\nAnalysis of the Post-ﬂight dataset showed that returning to ground did not signiﬁcantly\nimprove genome regulation and coordination of gene expression (Figure 1C), implying\nthat the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than\ncurrently thought. Extended care is necessary for astronauts to minimize the risk of disease\ndevelopment. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to\nthe Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid ap-\n\nLife2023 ,13, 576 5 of 15\nproaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate\nthe effects of space travel on human health. Another important question that needs to be\naddressed is whether the human body could establish a new “routine” for prolonged space\nstays and what this would look like in terms of astronauts’ health. We speculate that loss\nof gene expression coordination might also be responsible for other diseases/conditions\nastronauts experience, such as muscle loss and compromised immune system.

Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs \nBecause DEGs are the most altered genes du ring a biological process, we conducted \na signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight to figure \nout which biological functions are regulated by these genes. The top 11 signaling path-\nways were identified to be signal transduc tion, immune system, gene expression, metab-\nolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, \nmetabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease (Table 2). In total, 48 genes were found to be  involved in the regulation of these top 11 \nsignaling pathways. Moreover, it is obvious th at most of these DEGs are involved in the \nregulation of multiple signaling pathways, an d that these signaling pathways regulate a \nbroad range of biological, physiological, and/ or pathophysiological processes. This anal-\nysis reconfirms that space travel imposes co mprehensive effects on the human system ra-\nther than affecting an individual organ or tissue. \n  \nFigure 1.

As shown in Table 3, the\ntop 20 disease/disorder conditions can broadly be divided into three categories: neopla-\nsia/carcinoma, neurological disorder, and liver function, with the top three conditions\nbeing malignant neoplasm of the breast, colorectal carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm\nof the prostate. More DEGs were associated with tumor development than other dis-\neases/disorders. In 2019, Reynolds et al. reported the effect of space radiation on as-\ntronauts’ death using a statistical analysis [ 53]. Of the astronauts who traveled to space\nbetween 1960 and 2018, 53 NASA astronauts have died, with 16 of those deaths (30.2%)\nbeing caused by cancer. Nevertheless, their study indicates that space radiation does not\nstrongly impact the mortality of astronauts. This implies that weakened genome regulation\n(i.e., reduced gene expression correlation) is likely to be another key factor, in addition to\ncompromised immune function, in causing tumor development in astronauts. However,\nthese tumors may be less malignant or even benign [ 22–24]. Moreover, consistent with\nprevious studies [ 54,55], our results showed that space travel signiﬁcantly affects astronauts’\nliver function and liver metabolism. Key genes identiﬁed from our analysis, such as GPT\nand UBA5 , might serve as valuable monitoring biomarkers of astronauts’ liver function\nand even possible medical intervention points to protect astronauts’ health. Because liver\nis a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to\nestablish drug proﬁles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nexcretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into\nouter space. Space drug usage based on current information may be less effective or even\ndetrimental to astronauts’ health.\nTable 3.

Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel\nAny biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, includ-\ning gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic\nstudies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although\ngene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical\nresearch, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst to apply gene\npair correlation coefﬁcient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and\nmedical questions [ 50–52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health,\nwe selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations signiﬁcantly\naltered by space travel.\nWe calculated gene pair correlation coefﬁcients (designated as CC) of the DEGs as-\nsociated with the top 11 signaling pathways for the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight\ndatasets, and analyzed the gene pair correlation coefficient differentials (designated as DCC)\nbetween the In-flight and Pre-flight and between the Post-flight and In-flight (Figure 2). The\nchanges in gene pair CCs between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight datasets were obvious for\nevery signaling pathway, except the generic transcription pathway. However, the changes\nbetween Post-ﬂight and In-ﬂight CCs were minimal. Thus, using jDCCj> 0.70 as a cut-off,\nwe identiﬁed gene pairs with their correlation coefﬁcients signiﬁcantly altered between\nthe In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene pairs\nwere then classiﬁed into four categories based on changes in correlation coefﬁcients: Cat-\negory 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to\nnegative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown),\nand Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy\nthat Categories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that\nmany genes lost their coordination and even started counteractive processes in space. This\nobservation supports previous studies that found that spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly affects gene\nexpression and homeostasis [ 56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is\nthought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is\nlikely detrimental to astronauts’ health.\nIn a previous study, correlation was classiﬁed into three categories based on corre-\nlation coefﬁcients: strong (0.68 \u0014jCCj\u00141.00), moderate (0.36 \u0014jCCj\u00140.67), and weak\n(jCCj\u00140.35) [57]. To increase the sensitivity of the assay for space travel, it is rational to\nonly include gene pairs with correlations changing from strong to weak, weak to strong,\nor strong to opposite strong with jDCCj> 0.70. Using this guideline, we identiﬁed the\nfollowing gene pairs: 12 gene pairs from signal transduction, 11 gene pairs from immune\nsystem, 2 gene pairs from gene expression, 5 gene pairs from metabolism, 6 gene pairs\nfrom metabolism of proteins, 1 gene pair from developmental biology, 2 gene pairs from\nmetabolism of lipids and lipoprotein, 1 gene pair from axon guidance, 2 gene pairs from\ninnate immune system, and 1 gene pair from disease (Table 5). In total, 32 genes were\nselected, and they are AARS2 ,ACSL4 ,ATF2 ,BIRC2 ,CCL2 ,CCNC ,CHMP4C ,COL4A4 ,\nCREB1 ,CRHR1 ,CTNNBIP1 ,DPP4 ,EIF4E2 ,GNE ,GPT ,IL7,KIDINS220 ,MAGT1 ,NDUFA1 ,\nNFATC1 ,PCSK1 ,PDPK1 ,PIKFYVE ,PSAT1 ,RRN3 ,SOS2 ,SPON2 ,THBS3 ,UBR4 ,XAF1 ,\nYES1 , and ZNF606 .\nTo get a global view of the 32 genes regulating biological functions, we constructed\nthe protein–protein interaction (PPI), disease-gene, drug-gene, and miRNA-gene networks\nfor the 218 DEGs and labelled the 32 genes in the networks (Supplementary Figure S1).\nGenes that were present in the 32-gene list but not in the networks were not labelled.\nMost of the 32 identiﬁed genes have high degrees of connectivity and are likely to be\nbiological hubs. Thus, we propose that an RT2-PCR assay of these 32 genes could be a\nnovel, effective, and comparatively cheap way to continuously monitor astronauts’ health\nin space. Validation of this assay under microgravity simulation conditions is warranted\nfor further optimization of the gene list before sending an assay kit for practical tests in\nspace. Finally, we extracted the drug molecules (both approved and experimental, listed\nin Supplementary File S3: Drug_list.xls) and miRNAs (listed in Supplementary File S4:\n\nLife2023 ,13, 576 8 of 15\nmiRNA_list.xls) that potentially target these 32 genes from the drug-gene and miRNA-gene\nnetworks. These drugs and miRNAs could be applied as possible medical interventions for\nhealth conditions associated with space travel.\nLife 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16 \n \n the changes between Post-flight and In-flight CCs were minimal. Thus, using ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70 \nas a cut-off, we identified gene pairs with their correlation coefficients significantly altered \nbetween the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene \npairs were then classified into four categories based on changes in correlation coefficients: \nCategory 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to \nnegative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown), \nand Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy that \nCategories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that many genes lost their coordination and even start ed counteractive processes in space. This ob-\nservation supports previous studies that foun d that spaceflight significantly affects gene \nexpression and homeostasis [56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is \nthought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is likely detrimental to astronauts’ health. \nFigure 2.

Conclusions\nIn this study, we analyzed the effects of space travel on gene expression and correlation\nusing the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, and systematically devel-\noped a shortlist of genes for a novel rapid assay that could be used to monitor astronauts’\nhealth in space. However, this study faces a few limitations. First, the sample size (10 astro-\nnauts) is small due to the nature of space travel and unstandardized space biology research.\nMore sample collection is needed to optimize the monitoring assay. Secondly, there were\nonly two female astronauts in the microarray dataset. To get better representation and\nhigher accuracy in the analysis, more gene expression proﬁles from a diverse population of\nastronauts should be obtained. Future studies in simulated microgravity conditions will\nallow for the optimization and validation of the proposed assay. It is noteworthy that this\nassay may address only one facet of a complete monitoring and treatment approach for\nastronauts’ health in space. In practice, other factors such as biomarkers and physiological\nmetrics should also be included in the approach. Despite these drawbacks, our current\nstudy proposes a new strategy to develop genome-based rapid assays. This strategy could\nalso be applied to other research ﬁelds such as cancer diagnostic assays.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:\n//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life13020576/s1, File S1: DEG_list.xls; File S2: Disease_DEG.xls;\nFile S3: Drug_list.xls; File S4: miRNA_list.xls; Supplementary Figure S1: Protein-protein interac-\ntion (A), disease-gene (B), drug-gene (C) and miRNA-gene (D) networks for the 218 differentially\nexpressed genes (DEGs) between Pre-ﬂight and In-ﬂight gene expression datasets collected from\n10 astronauts (8 males and 2 females).
